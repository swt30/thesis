# Internal and atmospheric structures of heated watery super-Earths

Astronomers are discovering more and more *super-Earths*, planets around other stars whose sizes and masses lie somewhere between those of Earth and Neptune.
Some of these super-Earths may have very thick water layers.
Such planets are often referred to as *waterworlds*.
Water's unique behaviour across a range of temperatures and pressures, as well as its importance to life on Earth, means that these waterworlds are an interesting set of objects to model and explore.

This thesis explores the structure of these waterworlds, focusing on what happens when they are heated internally or externally.
