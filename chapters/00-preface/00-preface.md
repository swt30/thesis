          Astronomers are discovering more and more super-Earths, planets around other stars whose sizes and masses lie somewhere between those of Earth and Neptune. We would like to constrain their composition to investigate whether they are more similar to rocky Earth or gaseous Neptune. To do this we need numerical models of their interiors. These models often exclude any thermal effects, a choice justified by noting that a heated rocky planet expands by only a small amount. But this is not necessarily true for planets with thick oceans or watery atmospheres. Water has a rich and interesting thermal behaviour: at high pressure and temperature it can be in any of several exotic plasma and ice phases. Planets with thick water layers, known as waterworlds, cannot therefore be accurately represented by models that represent them as cold spheres. But understanding how waterworlds vary in size and structure is important as we seek to interpret new observations of super-Earths.

          We developed temperature-dependent structure models of waterworlds, treating both the interior structure and the atmosphere and including both internal and external heating. In doing so, we synthesized an improved equation of state for water to better capture how it behaves when heated or pressurised. Using these models, we show that: heat can significantly affect a watery planet’s size and structure; these planets can have large and diffuse yet opaque atmospheres; and a planet can have a hot extended steam atmosphere even if only moderately heated from the inside. Our models are simpler than those based on energy transfer codes, yet are fast to evaluate and still capture thermal behaviour trends appropriately. We therefore suggest that they would be ideally suited to use in population synthesis, where thousands of planetary structures are used to quantify the statistical behaviour of ensembles of planets. Finally, we also explore how a planet might change size if it migrates or exists in an elliptical orbit, and we consider the astrobiological implications of heating a watery planet.

preface: |
         This dissertation is the result of work at the Institute of Astronomy under the supervision of Nikku Madhusudhan. I carried out the work and wrote each chapter with his guidance; he provided advice, ideas, and some editing of the text. Two other academics at the Institute, Ian Parry and Christopher Tout, provided advice and editing. Aside from this, none of the work in this dissertation is the result of anything done in collaboration.

         All figures are my own except where indicated. All external sources of data are referenced in the text.

         Parts of this dissertation have been previously published or submitted for publication. Chapters 2 and 3 are based on our paper, "In hot water: effects of temperature-dependent interiors on the radii of water-rich super-Earths".^[@Thomas2016] Chapter 4 is based on "Internal heating of watery super-Earths", to be submitted.

         \newthought{I hereby declare} that this dissertation entitled "Internal and atmospheric structures of heated watery super-Earths" is the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration except as declared in this Preface and specified in the text. It is not substantially the same as any that I have submitted or is being concurrently submitted for a degree or diploma or other qualification at the University of Cambridge or any other University or similar institution.

         I further state that no substantial part of my dissertation has already been submitted or is being concurrently submitted for any such degree, diploma or other qualification at the University of Cambridge or any other University or similar institution.

         This dissertation does not exceed 60,000 words.
