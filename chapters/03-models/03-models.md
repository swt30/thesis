# Temperature-dependent models of watery planets

## Theory

### Planets with large watery layers

### Motivation for modelling these planets

### Model assumptions

### Structural equations

### Approaches to including temperature dependence

### The adiabatic (convective) temperature gradient

## Models

### The shooting approach compared to other methods

### A custom numerical integrator in Julia

### Conditions for convergence

## Results
