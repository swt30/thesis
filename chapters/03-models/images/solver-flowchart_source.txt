// The model parameters include the mass M, surface pressure P(M), and the surface temperature T(M)
Specify model
parameters and
boundary conditions;
// The radius R, which is the guess for the planet's total radius, is chosen as the midpoint of the current radius search bracket
solve:
Set trial radius R;
// The ODEs contain the rest of the information about the layered structure of the planet, the water EOS and the temperature profile
Evaluate ODEs with
RK integration[Structural model];
