# A water-rich super-Earth?

For the majority of my PhD I was not certain that these models would be useful in more than a theoretical sense.
To have a nice set of models is one thing, but of course our ultimate goal is to actually use them to interpret observations.
And although I have shown that it is important to consider temperature when modelling watery planets, there are no immediate courses of action that arise from this apart from "make sure to include temperature in your models".

However, just a few weeks ago I was fortunate to receive news that water had possibly been detected in the atmosphere of the rocky super-Earth Gliese 1132 b.
This heated watery super-Earth is therefore nearly a perfect candidate for my models.

In this chapter, I present the results of applying my models to this super-Earth.
These results were obtained by Oliver Shorttle, who used my code \smallcaps{OGRE} to analyse the potential composition of this planet.
Because I did not carry out the analysis myself, this chapter will be brief, but I have included it as an example of the first direct application of my models to observational data.

The results will be published in...

## Gliese 1132 b

The planet Gliese 1132 b, hereafter GJ 1132b, was discovered by MEarth\marginnote{
  MEarth is a survey that searches for Earth-like planets around M dwarfs. It takes advantage of the "small star opportunity": small faint stars such as M dwarfs have proportionally larger transits because the ratio of stellar to planetary radius is lower. Because small planets are common around these cooler stars, they represent a strong potential source of super-Earth detections.
