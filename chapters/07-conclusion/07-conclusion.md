Understanding how the mass--radius relation can be affected by temperature allows us to take the step of detecting and characterising water-rich planets, taking their surface temperatures into account while modelling them.
This is an important precursor to narrow the search to planets that would be considered more classically habitable.
It will be especially useful in the context of the next generation of super-Earths expected to be found orbiting bright stars by missions such as PLATO^[@Rauer2014], TESS^[@Ricker2014] and CHEOPS^[@Broeg2013].
This approach is promising because it is linked to the characteristic equilibrium temperature, which can be determined from observations of the planet, and so can be included in analyses of populations of planets.
Through this we might better understand what proportion of planets include substantial water content.

We look forward to two developments in particular.
The first is improved atmospheric characterisation and modelling, which will provide useful pressure and temperature boundary conditions at the base of the atmosphere.
The question of interior--atmospheric interactions is a rich one that is only starting to be explored.
Integrating atmospheric and interior models promises progress on questions about surface chemistry, outgassing and other processes that can shape the atmosphere of a planet.
The second development that will make use of this work is improved spectral resolution of atmospheric observations, and in particular the ability to seek out atmospheric windows.^[@Madhusudhan2015]
By observing at wavelengths which pass through the atmosphere, we can in principle directly measure the radius of any solid interior underneath that atmosphere and thus have a better starting point for interpreting the interior structure.
