# Summary and conclusion

Water-rich super-Earths present a fascinating target for theoretical studies of planetary interiors and atmospheres.
As we have just seen, these theories are becoming reality, with new observations already appearing and more on their way.

Why do we care about watery super-Earths?
We care because they represent an important class of planets---not quite like anything in our solar system, but not alien to us.
We care because water is such an important, life-giving substance on Earth that we seek it out throughout the Universe to understand if it could have given rise to life elsewhere.
And therefore we care because these planets represent one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time: are we alone?
Planets and moons with watery layers are currently our best hope for answering this question.

This dissertation has focused on modelling and understanding water-rich super-Earths.
In it I have asked how the presence of water affects both the observable properties and the internal structures of these planets.
Because our information on exoplanet interiors is limited in the best case to their masses and radii, we must necessarily work in an information-poor environment when we do this.
This poses a problem because it leads to a fundamental degeneracy in potential interior structures.
But it is also an opportunity for us to put our theories to work and explore which parameters are important to the final structure.

\newthought{In this dissertation} I have explored several different areas relating to the internal and atmospheric structures of water-rich super-Earths.

I began by constructing a comprehensive water equation of state that includes a full treatment of temperature dependence.
This temperature-dependent equation of state is important because of water's rich and varied phase structure, and because planets with thick water layers can have internal pressures and temperatures that span several orders of magnitude.

Next, I set out to understand how the physical properties of a water-rich planet are affected by temperature.
I included an adiabatic temperature gradient in my models, which is the expected temperature gradient for a planet that is transporting energy via convection.
I showed that planets with watery layers are sensitive to temperature changes, especially when this new equation of state is included.
The degree of change depends on a number of factors, but it is clear that the temperature dependence is an important component of these models that should not be neglected.

I then included a treatment for the planet's atmosphere to make the link to a planet's physical transit radius.
I used an analytic two-stream atmospheric temperature profile.
It is physically motivated yet simple enough for our needs; and it lets us examine the effects of internal and external heating on the planet's structure.
Though this atmospheric treatment makes a number of simplifying assumptions, it has proved to be very useful for understanding the structure of the planet's atmosphere.
By including this atmospheric profile, I showed that the atmosphere can have a significant temperature-dependent contribution to the observable radius of a water-rich planet.
I also showed that the water opacity is a critically important parameter: it controls the atmospheric boundary conditions and therefore affects the structure of the entire model.

Next, I applied my models to the context of a migrating planet.
I asked how the phase structure of a watery planet can vary with internal and external heating; more specifically, I investigated this by modelling planets moving closer to their host star.
By modelling their heated interiors, I was able to show that the phase structure of these planets remains roughly similar during migration, though the radius can be significantly inflated by heating when the planet approaches the star.

Finally, I presented the results of using my models to analyse the interior structure and geology of the planet GJ 1132b.
GJ 1132b's mass and radius can be explained by a planet with a water layer over a molten silicate mantle.
Though the water mass fraction is not well-constrained, this fits with new spectral observations of the planet that suggest it has a watery atmosphere.

\newthought{What of the future?}
Where is the field headed, and how do contributions like these fit into the picture?
By understanding how the mass--radius relation can be affected by temperature, we can detecting and characterise water-rich planets while including their surface temperatures in our models.
This is an important precursor to narrow the search to planets that would be considered more classically habitable.
It will be especially useful in the context of the next generation of super-Earths expected to be found orbiting bright stars by missions such as PLATO^[@Rauer2014], TESS^[@Ricker2014] and CHEOPS^[@Broeg2013].
My approach is promising because it is linked to the characteristic equilibrium temperature, which can be determined from observations of the planet, and so can be included in analyses of populations of planets.
Through this we might better understand what proportion of planets include substantial water content.

I look forward to two developments in particular.
The first is improved atmospheric characterisation and modelling, which will provide useful pressure and temperature boundary conditions at the base of the atmosphere.
The question of interior--atmospheric interactions is a rich one that is only starting to be explored.
Integrating atmospheric and interior models promises progress on questions about surface chemistry, outgassing and other processes that can shape the atmosphere of a planet.
The second development that will make use of this work is improved spectral resolution of atmospheric observations, and in particular the ability to seek out atmospheric windows.^[@Madhusudhan2015]
By observing at wavelengths which pass through the atmosphere, we can in principle directly measure the radius of any solid interior underneath that atmosphere and thus have a better starting point for interpreting the interior structure.
The case of GJ 1132b in @sec:a-water-rich-super-earth is an excellent early example of this sort of work.
With models like these combined with stunning new observations, our future understanding of these intriguing planets looks bright indeed.
