# Internal and atmospheric structures of heated watery super-Earths
## Response to requested corrections â€“ Scott Thomas

1) A discussion of solar system icy bodies should be added to the introduction.

2) The explanation of interpolation across the boundaries between tables used in the equation of state must include a figure showing discontinuities in heat capacity and a discussion thereof.

3) The assumption of adiabatic internal structure must be justified early on because the models all depend on it. It should be demonstrated that neither radiation nor conduction could transport heat given an adiabatic temperature gradient so that convection is necessary. Whether convection might be inhibited by composition gradients or viscosity effects should be investigated.

4) The assumptions made in the treatment, specifically of latent heat, of phase boundaries must be described in detail. A critical discussion of whether these assumptions are always reasonable and the physical motivation for the treatment of phase transitions in section 5.1.1 must be included.

5) In chapter 4 there are physical problems with the matching of a radiative atmosphere to an adiabatic interior. Instead of the arbitrary transition at a pressure of $100\,$bar the temperature gradients should be matched. A figure or figures demonstrating this must be included.

6) Parentheses in equation (4.15) are misplaced. Check whether or not the formula is correct in any numerical codes and rerun as necessary.

The misplaced parenthesis was a typo that did not affect any numerical code. I have corrected equation (4.15) appropriately.

7) The effects of a larger internal energy generation rate are interesting. Construct and include such models.

8) A more precise description of figure 4.9 is required, along with a precise definition of effective temperature when irradiation is included.
