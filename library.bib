abstract = {A phase change may hinder or enhance convection, depending on its characteristics. Univariant transformations such as may occur in the mantle constitute a barrier to convection unless the motion starts at some distance above or below the transition level; an initial temperature gradient in excess of the adiabatic value is also required. Multivariant transformations only require, in the transformation zone, an initial gradient slightly greater than the adiabatic value for a homogeneous layer. The effect on convection of transformation rates is not likely to be serious.},

abstract = {Tremendous progress in the science of extrasolar planets has been achieved since the discovery of a Jupiter orbiting the nearby Sun-like star 51 Pegasi in 1995. Theoretical models have now reached enough maturity to predict the characteristic properties of these new worlds, mass, radius, atmospheric signatures, and can be confronted with available observations. We review our current knowledge of the physical properties of exoplanets, internal structure and composition, atmospheric signatures, including expected biosignatures for exo-Earth planets, evolution, and the impact of tidal interaction and stellar irradiation on these properties for the short-period planets. We discuss the most recent theoretical achievements in the field and the still pending questions. We critically analyze the different solutions suggested to explain abnormally large radii of a significant fraction of transiting exoplanets. Special attention is devoted to the recently discovered transiting objects in the overlapping mass range between massive planets and low-mass brown dwarfs, stressing the ambiguous nature of these bodies, and we discuss the possible observable diagnostics to identify these two distinct populations. We also review our present understanding of planet formation and critically examine the different suggested formation mechanisms. We expect this review will provide the basic theoretical background to capture the essentials of the physics of exoplanet formation, structure and evolution and the related observable signatures.},

abstract = {A class of extrasolar giant planets--the so-called 'hot Jupiters' (ref. 1)--orbit within 0.05 au of their primary stars (1 au is the Sun-Earth distance). These planets should be hot and so emit detectable infrared radiation. The planet HD 209458b (refs 3, 4) is an ideal candidate for the detection and characterization of this infrared light because it is eclipsed by the star. This planet has an anomalously large radius (1.35 times that of Jupiter), which may be the result of ongoing tidal dissipation, but this explanation requires a non-zero orbital eccentricity (approximately 0.03; refs 6, 7), maintained by interaction with a hypothetical second planet. Here we report detection of infrared (24 microm) radiation from HD 209458b, by observing the decrement in flux during secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the star. The planet's 24-microm flux is 55 +/- 10 microJy (1sigma), with a brightness temperature of 1,130 +/- 150 K, confirming the predicted heating by stellar irradiation. The secondary eclipse occurs at the midpoint between transits of the planet in front of the star (to within +/- 7 min, 1sigma), which means that a dynamically significant orbital eccentricity is unlikely.},

@article{Mordasini2014,
abstract = {Despite the increase in observational data on exoplanets, the processes that lead to the formation of planets are still not well understood. But thanks to the high number of known exoplanets, it is now possible to look at them as a population that puts statistical constraints on theoretical models. A method that uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis. Its key element is a global model of planet formation and evolution that directly predicts observable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary disk. To do so, global models build on many specialized models that address one specific physical process. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models included in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models describing the protoplanetary disk (gas and solids), the (proto)planet (solid core, gaseous envelope, and atmosphere), and finally the interactions (migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches in different global models and identify physical processes that require improved descriptions in future. We then address important results of population synthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass-radius relation. In these results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during planet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models describing them can be put to the observational test. Due to their nature as meta models, global models depend on the development of the field of planet formation theory as a whole. Because there are important uncertainties in this theory, it is likely that global models will in future undergo significant modifications. Despite this, they can already now yield many testable predictions. With future global models addressing the geophysical characteristics, it should eventually become possible to make predictions about the habitability of planets.},

@article{Guillot1999,
abstract = {Interior models of Jupiter and Saturn are calculated and compared in the framework of the three-layer assumption, which rely on the perception that both planets consist of three globally homogeneous regions: a dense core, a metallic hydrogen envelope, and a molecular hydrogen envelope. Within this framework, constraints on the core mass and abundance of heavy elements (i.e. elements other than hydrogen and helium) are given by accounting for uncertainties on the measured gravitational moments, surface temperature, surface helium abundance, and on the inferred protosolar helium abundance, equations of state, temperature profile and solid/differential interior rotation. Results obtained solely from static models matching the measured gravitational fields indicate that the mass of Jupiter's dense core is less than 14 M⊕ (Earth masses), but that models with no core are possible given the current uncertainties on the hydrogen–helium equation of state. Similarly, Saturn's core mass is less than 22 M⊕ but no lower limit can be inferred. The total mass of heavy elements (including that in the core) is constrained to lie between 11 and 42 M⊕ in Jupiter, and between 19 and 31 M⊕ in Saturn. The enrichment in heavy elements of their molecular envelopes is 1–6.5, and 0.5–12 times the solar value, respectively. Additional constraints from evolution models accounting for the progressive differentiation of helium (Hubbard WB, Guillot T, Marley MS, Burrows A, Lunine JI, Saumon D, 1999. Comparative evolution of Jupiter and Saturn. Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1175–1182) are used to obtain tighter, albeit less robust, constraints. The resulting core masses are then expected to be in the range 0–10 M⊕, and 6–17 M⊕ for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that Saturn's atmospheric helium mass mixing ratio, as derived from Voyager, Y=0.06±0.05, is probably too low. Static and evolution models favor a value of Y=0.11−0.25. Using, Y=0.16±0.05, Saturn's molecular region is found to be enriched in heavy elements by 3.5 to 10 times the solar value, in relatively good agreement with the measured methane abundance. Finally, in all cases, the gravitational moment J6 of models matching all the constraints are found to lie between 0.35 and 0.38×10−4 for Jupiter, and between 0.90 and 0.98×10−4 for Saturn, assuming solid rotation. For comparison, the uncertainties on the measured J6 are about 10 times larger. More accurate measurements of J6 (as expected from the Cassini orbiter for Saturn) will therefore permit to test the validity of interior models calculations and the magnitude of differential rotation in the planetary interior.},

abstract = {We aim to present a generalized Bayesian inference method for constraining interiors of super Earths and sub-Neptunes. Our methodology succeeds in quantifying the degeneracy and correlation of structural parameters for high dimensional parameter spaces. Specifically, we identify what constraints can be placed on composition and thickness of core, mantle, ice, ocean, and atmospheric layers given observations of mass, radius, and bulk refractory abundance constraints (Fe, Mg, Si) from observations of the host star's photospheric composition. We employed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis that formally accounts for observational and model uncertainties. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we computed joint and marginal posterior probability distributions for all structural parameters of interest. We included state-of-the-art structural models based on self-consistent thermodynamics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice, and liquid water. Furthermore, we tested and compared two different atmospheric models that are tailored for modeling thick and thin atmospheres, respectively. First, we validate our method against Neptune. Second, we apply it to synthetic exoplanets of fixed mass and determine the effect on interior structure and composition when (1) radius, (2) atmospheric model, (3) data uncertainties, (4) semi-major axes, (5) atmospheric composition (i.e., a priori assumption of enriched envelopes versus pure H/He envelopes), and (6) prior distributions are varied.

abstract = {The internal thermal and magnetic evolution of rocky exoplanets is critical to their habitability. We focus on the thermal-orbital evolution of Earth-mass planets around low-mass M stars whose radiative habitable zone overlaps with the "tidal zone," where tidal dissipation is expected to be a significant heat source in the interior. We develop a thermal-orbital evolution model calibrated to Earth that couples tidal dissipation, with a temperature-dependent Maxwell rheology, to orbital circularization and migration. We illustrate thermal-orbital steady states where surface heat flow is balanced by tidal dissipation and cooling can be stalled for billions of years until circularization occurs. Orbital energy dissipated as tidal heat in the interior drives both inward migration and circularization, with a circularization time that is inversely proportional to the dissipation rate. We identify a peak in the internal dissipation rate as the mantle passes through a viscoelastic state at mantle temperatures near 1800 K. Planets orbiting a 0.1 solar-mass star within 0.07 AU circularize before 10 Gyr, independent of initial eccentricity. Once circular, these planets cool monotonically and maintain dynamos similar to that of Earth. Planets forced into eccentric orbits can experience a super-cooling of the core and rapid core solidification, inhibiting dynamo action for planets in the habitable zone. We find that tidal heating is insignificant in the habitable zone around 0.45 (or larger) solar-mass stars because tidal dissipation is a stronger function of orbital distance than stellar mass, and the habitable zone is farther from larger stars. Suppression of the planetary magnetic field exposes the atmosphere to stellar wind erosion and the surface to harmful radiation. In addition to weak magnetic fields, massive melt eruption rates and prolonged magma oceans may render eccentric planets in the habitable zone of low-mass stars inhospitable for life.},

abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90{\%} of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of {\~{}}0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are {\~{}}40{\%}-50{\%} larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

abstract = {The research of exoplanets has entered an era in which we characterize extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of radii and luminosities. Meanwhile, radial velocity surveys discover also very low-mass planets. Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking. Our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all these observational methods. We continue to describe how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. We show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core and radiogenic heating. We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we conduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to "forbidden" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed one, finding good agreement for a{\textgreater}0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local maximum at {\~{}}1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows agreement for R{\textgreater}2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at {\~{}}1 Jovian radius.},

@article{Kurosaki2014,
abstract = {Context. Recent progress in transit photometry opened a new window to the interior of super-Earths. From measured radii and masses, we can infer constraints on planetary internal compositions. It has been recently revealed that super-Earths orbiting close to host stars (i.e., hot super-Earths) are diverse in composition. This diversity is thought to arise from diversity in volatile content. Aims: The stability of the volatile components, which we call the envelopes, is to be examined, because hot super-Earths, which are exposed to strong irradiation, undergo photo-evaporative mass loss. While several studies investigated the impact of photo-evaporative mass loss on hydrogen-helium envelopes, there are few studies as to the impact on water-vapor envelopes, which we investigate in this study. To obtain theoretical prediction to future observations, we also investigate the relationships among masses, radii, and semi-major axes of water-rich super-Earths and also sub-Earths that have undergone photo-evaporative mass loss. Methods: We simulate the interior structure and evolution of highly-irradiated sub/super-Earths that consist of a rocky core surrounded by a water envelope, which include mass loss due to the stellar XUV-driven energy-limited hydrodynamic escape. Results: We find that the photo-evaporative mass loss has a significant impact on the evolution of hot sub/super-Earths. With a widely-used empirical formula for XUV flux from typical G-stars and the heating efficiency of 0.1 for example, the planets of less than 3 Earth masses orbiting 0.03 AU have their water envelopes completely stripped off. We then derive the threshold planetary mass and radius below which the planet loses its water envelope completely as a function of the initial water content and find that there are minimums of the threshold mass and radius. Conclusions: We constrain the domain in the parameter space of planetary mass, radius, and the semi-major axis in which sub/super-Earths never retain water envelopes in 1-10 Gyr. This would provide an essential piece of information for understanding the origin of close-in, low-mass planets. The current uncertainties in stellar XUV flux and its heating efficiency, however, prevent us from deriving robust conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems to be a robust conclusion that Kepler planet candidates contain a significant number of rocky sub/super-Earths.

abstract = {In this work, we study the transport of methane in the external water envelopes surrounding water-rich super-Earths. We investigate the influence of methane on the thermodynamics and mechanics of the water mantle. We find that including methane in the water matrix introduces a new phase (filled ice), resulting in hotter planetary interiors. This effect renders the super-ionic and reticulating phases accessible to the lower ice mantle of relatively low-mass planets ({\~{}}5 ME ) lacking a H/He atmosphere. We model the thermal and structural profile of the planetary crust and discuss five possible crustal regimes which depend on the surface temperature and heat flux. We demonstrate that the planetary crust can be conductive throughout or partly confined to the dissociation curve of methane clathrate hydrate. The formation of methane clathrate in the subsurface is shown to inhibit the formation of a subterranean ocean. This effect results in increased stresses on the lithosphere, making modes of ice plate tectonics possible. The dynamic character of the tectonic plates is analyzed and the ability of this tectonic mode to cool the planet is estimated. The icy tectonic plates are found to be faster than those on a silicate super-Earth. A mid-layer of low viscosity is found to exist between the lithosphere and the lower mantle. Its existence results in a large difference between ice mantle overturn timescales and resurfacing timescales. Resurfacing timescales are found to be 1 Ma for fast plates and 100 Ma for sluggish plates, depending on the viscosity profile and ice mass fraction. Melting beneath spreading centers is required in order to account for the planetary radiogenic heating. The melt fraction is quantified for the various tectonic solutions explored, ranging from a few percent for the fast and thin plates to total melting of the upwelled material for the thick and sluggish plates. Ice mantle dynamics is found to be important for assessing the composition of the atmosphere. We propose a mechanism for methane release into the atmosphere, where freshly exposed reservoirs of methane clathrate hydrate at the ridge dissociate under surface conditions. We formulate the relation between the outgassing flux and the tectonic mode dynamical characteristics. We give numerical estimates for the global outgassing rate of methane into the atmosphere. We find, for example, that for a 2 ME planet outgassing can release 1027-1029 molecules s–1 of methane to the atmosphere. We suggest a qualitative explanation for how the same outgassing mechanism may result in either a stable or a runaway volatile release, depending on the specifics of a given planet. Finally, we integrate the global outgassing rate for a few cases and quantify how the surface atmospheric pressure of methane evolves over time. We find that methane is likely an important constituent of water planets' atmospheres.},

This equation of state covers the complete range of conditions encountered in planetary modeling. We use first principles quantum molecular dynamics simulations and its Thomas-Fermi extension to reach the highest pressures encountered in giant planets several times the size of Jupiter. Using these results, as well as the data available at lower pressures, we obtain a parametrization of the Helmholtz free energy adjusted over this extended temperature and pressure domain. The parametrization ignores the entropy and density jumps at phase boundaries but we show that it is sufficiently accurate to model interior properties of most planets and exoplanets. We produce an equation of state given in analytical form that is readily usable in planetary modeling codes and dynamical simulations {\{}$\backslash$bf (a fortran implementation can be found at http://www.ioffe.ru/astro/H2O/){\}}. The EOS produced is valid for the entire density range relevant to planetary modeling, {\{}$\backslash$bf for densities where quantum effects for the ions can be neglected, and for temperatures below 50,000K.

As in the first edition, this volume begins with a rigorous treatment of coordinate frames, basic positional astronomy, and the celestial mechanics of two and restricted three body system problems. Perturbations are treated in the same way, with clear step-by-step derivations. Then the Earth's gravitational potential field and the Earth-Moon system are discussed, and the exposition turns to radiation properties with a chapter on the Sun. The exposition of the physical properties of the Moon and the terrestrial planets are greatly expanded, with much new information highlighted on the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars.All of the material is presented within a framework of historical importance. This book and its sister volume, Solar System Astrophysics: Background Science and the Inner Solar system, are pedagogically well written, providing clearly illustrated explanations, for example, of such topics as the numerical integration of the Adams-Williamson equation, the equations of state in planetary interiors and atmospheres, Maxwell's equations as applied to planetary ionospheres and magnetospheres, and the physics and chemistry of the Habitable Zone in planetary systems.Together, the volumes form a comprehensive text for any university course that aims to deal with all aspects of solar and extra-solar planetary systems. They will appeal separately to the intellectually curious who would like to know how just how far our knowledge of the solar system has progressed in recent years.},

abstract = {A mass-radius (M-R) relationship is proposed for solid planets and solid cores ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets. It relies on the assumption that solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable amount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets. Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained. Similarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified. It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and temperature are secondary compared to the effect of the amount of water. The super-Earth family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich, water-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius increases significantly from the iron-rich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even if some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to ascertain the discovery of an Earth-like planet. The present work describes how the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate depends on several assumptions including (1) the accuracy of the internal structure model and (2) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard deviation of the amount of water is about 4.5{\%}. This value increases rapidly with the radius uncertainty but does not strongly depend on the mass uncertainty.},

@article{Madhusudhan2012,
abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O {\textgreater}= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O {\textgreater}= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally underabundant for C/O {\textgreater}= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations, we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

abstract = {Insights into a distant exoplanet's interior are possible given a synergy between models and observations. Spectral observations of a star's radial velocity wobble induced by an orbiting planet's gravitational pull measure the planet mass. Photometric transit observations of a planet crossing the disk of its star measure the planet radius. This thesis interprets the measured masses and radii of super-Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets, employing models to constrain the planets' bulk compositions, formation histories, and habitability. We develop a model for the internal structure of low-mass exoplanets consisting of up to four layers: an iron core, silicate mantle, ice layer, and gas layer. We quantify the span of plausible bulk compositions for low-mass transiting planets CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b, and describe how Bayesian analysis can be applied to rigorously account for observational, model, and inherent uncertainties. We present a detailed case study of GJ 1214b, the first exemplar of a new class of volatile-rich super-Earth exoplanets. At 6.5 M and 2.7 R, GJ 1214b must have a gas layer to account for its low mean density. We present three possible scenarios for the origin of the gas layer on GJ 1214b: direct accretion of H/He gas from the protoplanetary nebula, sublimation of ices, and outgassing of volatiles from a rocky interior. We next explore the low-density extreme of the mass-radius relations for volatile- rich super-Earth exoplanets. Using models of planet formation, structure, and survival, we constrain the minimum plausible planet mass for a measured planet radius and equi- librium temperature. We explore both core-nucleated accretion and outgassing as two separate formation pathways for Neptune-size planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases. Finally, we present a practical method to assess whether a hydrogen-rich sub- Neptune planet with measured mass and radius could potentially harbor a liquid water ocean. Using a one-dimensional radiative-convective model of energy transport through water-saturated hydrogen-rich envelopes, we constrain the combinations of planet properties (mass, radius, equilibrium temperature, intrinsic luminosity) that 3 are conducive to liquid water oceans. The pace of low-mass exoplanet discoveries is poised to accelerate, and this thesis will contribute to constraining the interior properties of newfound planets.},

Seager {\&} Mall{\'{e}}n-Ornelas demonstrated that it was possible to discern between blends and exoplanets using only the photometric characteristics of the transits. However, these techniques are critically dependent on the shape of the transit, characterization of which requires very high precision photometry of a sort that is atypical for candidates identified from transit searches. We present a method relying only on transit duration, depth, and period, which require much less precise photometry to determine accurately. The numerical tool we derive, the exoplanet diagnostic $\eta$, is intended to identify the subset of candidates from a transit search that is most likely to contain exoplanets and is thus most worthy of subsequent follow-up studies. The effectiveness of the diagnostic is demonstrated with its success in separating modeled exoplanetary transits and interlopers and by applying it to actual OGLE transit candidates.},

abstract = {We show that, for a low-mass planet that orbits its host star within several tenths of an AU (like the majority of the Kepler planets), the atmosphere it was able to accumulate while embedded in the proto-planetary disk may not survive unscathed after the disk disperses. This gas envelope, if more massive than a few percent of the core (with a mass below {\$}10 M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}), has a cooling time that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the disk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original size, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be losing mass via a Parker wind that is energized by the stellar continuum radiation. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the envelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere rapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order {\$}0.1{\$} Bondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a million years after the disk disperses, we find a planet retains only about ten percent of its original envelope, and has a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much longer than its actual age. We suggest that this "boil-off" process may be responsible for the lack of planets above a radius of {\$}2.5 R{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} in the Kepler data.},

abstract = {Observational advancements are leading to increasingly precise measurements of super-Earth masses and radii. Such measurements are used in internal structure models to constrain interior compositions of super-Earths. It is now critically important to quantify the effect of various model assumptions on the predicted radii. In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice justified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is small. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be significant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal effects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of masses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We developed temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich super-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation of state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their radii. For example, for super-Earths with 10 per cent water by mass, the radius increases by up to 0.5 R{\{}oplus{\}} when the surface temperature is increased from 300 to 1000 K, assuming a surface pressure of 100 bar and an adiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even larger at lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures, while changing the water fraction makes only a marginal difference. These effects are comparable to current super-Earth radial measurement errors, which can be better than 0.1 R{\{}oplus{\}}. It is therefore important to ensure that the thermal behaviour of water is taken into account when interpreting super-Earth radii using internal structure models.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of Kepler-10 b, the smallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by the spacecraft. A second, 45 day period transit-like signal present in the photometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as being caused by a planet at the time of that announcement. Here we apply the light curve modeling technique known as BLENDER to explore the possibility that the signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). To aid in this analysis we report the observation of two transits with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 $\mu$m. When combined, they yield a transit depth of 344 ± 85 ppm that is consistent with the depth in the Kepler passband (376 ± 9 ppm, ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of a significantly different color than the target. Using these observations along with other constraints from high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, we are able to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. We assess the likelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarm rate of 1.6 × 10–5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as a planet (designated Kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. The radius of this object is measured to be Rp = 2.227+0.052 –0.057 R ⊕ (in which the error includes the uncertainty in the stellar properties), but currently available radial-velocity measurements only place an upper limit on its mass of about 20 M ⊕. Kepler-10 c represents another example (with Kepler-9 d and Kepler-11 g) of statistical validation of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual confirmation that can take place when the Doppler signal is detected or transit timing variations are measured. It is anticipated that many of Kepler's smaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamical confirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of current instrumentation.},

abstract = {The composition of exoplanets is interesting for theoretical reasons and for possible implications of planet habitability. Currently, only the mass and radius are able to be used to estimate the composition of well-understood transiting exoplanets. With only these parameters to depend on, there is still significant uncertainty in the interior composition, as there are many possible interior compositions for a planet with a given mass and radius. Another observable parameter that could be used is k2, the planetary Love number, a measurement of the central condensation of a planet (equivalent to J2) that could be measurable in the future via repeated transit measurements (Ragozzine {\&} Wolf 2009, Batygin et al. 2009). We have developed a program that calculates the k2 of planets from their interior density distribution by numerically integrating the Clairaut-Radau equation. The model has been applied to a large sample of terrestrial planets ranging from 0.5-8 Earth masses and 0.5-5 Earth radii. These sample planets have a wide variety of compositions iron, rock, ice, and gas (from Rodgers {\&} Seager 2009 and Zeng {\&} Seager 2008) to explore how k2 can be used to break the degeneracy of interior composition, even for model planets with well-known masses and radii (see also Kramm et al. 2011). We will present the value of k2 measurements in narrowing the range of possible interior structures of terrestrial planets. We will make the software that calculates k2 available for theorists to use in related studies of exoplanets.},

abstract = {The field of extrasolar planets has rapidly expanded to include the detection of planets with masses smaller than that of Uranus. Many of these are expected to have little or no hydrogen and helium gas, and we might find Earth analogs among them. In this paper we describe our detailed interior models for a rich variety of such massive terrestrial and ocean planets in the 1-10 M⊕ range (super-Earths). The grid presented here allows the characterization of the bulk composition of super-Earths detected in transit and with a measured mass. We show that, on average, planet radius measurements to better than 5{\%}, combined with mass measurements to better than 10{\%}, would permit us to distinguish between an icy or rocky composition. This is due to the fact that there is a maximum radius a rocky terrestrial planet may achieve for a given mass. Any value of the radius above this maximum terrestrial radius implies that the planet contains a large ({\textgreater}10{\%}) amount of water (ocean planet).},

The pressure dependencies of the volume and bulk modulus of ice VII at room temperature are in good agreement with previous synchrotron x‐ray studies. The thermal expansivity was determined as a function of pressure and the results fit to a newly proposed phenomenological relation and to a Mie–Gr{\"{u}}neisen equation of state formalism. The onset of melting of ice VII was determined directly by x‐ray diffraction at a series of pressures and found to be in accord with previous volumetric determinations. Thermodynamic calculations based on the new data are performed to evaluate the range of validity of previously proposed equations of state for fluid water derived from static and shock‐wave compression experiments and from simulations.},

abstract = {The core accretion theory for giant planet formation predicts enrichment of elemental abundances in planetary envelopes caused by runaway accretion of planetesimals, which is consistent with measured super-solar abundances of C, N, P, S, Xe, and Ar in Jupiter's atmosphere. However, the abundance of O which is expected to be the most dominant constituent of planetesimals is unknown for solar system giant planets, owing to the condensation of water in their ultra-cold atmospheres, thereby posing a key unknown in solar system formation. On the other hand, hundreds of extrasolar hot Jupiters are known with very high temperatures ({\textgreater}{\~{}}1000 K) making them excellent targets to measure H2O abundances and, hence, oxygen in their atmospheres. We constrain the atmospheric H2O abundances in three hot Jupiters (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, and WASP-12b), spanning a wide temperature range (1200-2500 K), using their near-infrared transmission spectra obtained using the HST WFC3 instrument. We report conclusive measurements of H2O in HD 189733b and HD 209458b, while that in WASP-12b is not well constrained by present data. The data allow nearly solar as well as significantly sub-solar abundances in HD 189733b and WASP-12b. However, for HD 209458b, we report the most precise H2O measurement in an exoplanet to date that suggests a {\~{}}20-135 sub-solar H2O abundance. We discuss the implications of our results on the formation conditions of hot Jupiters and on the likelihood of clouds in their atmospheres. Our results highlight the critical importance of high-precision spectra of hot Jupiters for deriving their H2O abundances.},

This is the only multi-planet system discovered by any method with measured masses for the star and both planets. In addition to the signatures of two planets, this event also exhibits a microlensing parallax signature and finite source effects that provide a direct measure of the masses of the star and planets, and the expected brightness of the host star is confirmed by Keck AO imaging, yielding masses of , Mb = 231 ± 19 M ⊕, and Mc = 86 ± 7 M ⊕. The Saturn-analog planet in this system had a planetary light-curve deviation that lasted for 11 days, and as a result, the effects of the orbital motion are visible in the microlensing light curve. We find that four of the six orbital parameters are tightly constrained and that a fifth parameter, the orbital acceleration, is weakly constrained. No orbital information is available for the Jupiter-analog planet, but its presence helps to constrain the orbital motion of the Saturn-analog planet. Assuming co-planar orbits, we find an orbital eccentricity of and an orbital inclination of . The 95{\%} confidence level lower limit on the inclination of i {\textgreater} 49° implies that this planetary system can be detected and studied via radial velocity measurements using a telescope of 30 m aperture.},

abstract = {This paper describes the status of the 2012 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2008 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is comprised of six major components structured into folders that are freely accessible on the internet. These folders consist of the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, ultraviolet spectroscopic parameters, aerosol indices of refraction, collision-induced absorption data, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, and validity. Molecules and isotopologues have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Also discussed is a new initiative that casts HITRAN into a relational database format that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure that has existed since the initial release of HITRAN in the early 1970s.},

abstract = {Project 1640 is a high-contrast imaging instrument recently commissioned at the Palomar observatory. A combination of a coronagraph with an integral-field spectrograph (IFS), Project 1640 is designed to detect and characterize extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, and circumstellar material orbiting nearby stars. In this paper, we present our data processing techniques for improving upon instrument raw sensitivity via the removal of quasi-static speckles. Our approach utilizes the chromatic image diversity provided by the IFS in combination with the locally optimized combination of images algorithm to suppress the intensity of residual contaminating light in close angular proximity to target stars. We describe the Project 1640 speckle suppression pipeline and demonstrate its ability to detect companions with brightness comparable to and below that of initial speckle intensities using on-sky commissioning data. Our preliminary results indicate that suppression factors of at least one order of magnitude are consistently possible, reaching 5$\sigma$ contrast levels of 2.1 × 10-5 at 1'' in the H band in 20 minutes of on-source integration time when non-common-path errors are reasonably well calibrated. These results suggest that near-infrared contrast levels of order ≈10-7 at subarcsecond separations will soon be possible for Project 1640 and similarly designed instruments that receive a diffraction-limited beam corrected by adaptive optics systems employing deformable mirrors with high actuator density.},

Astronomers are beginning to model the atmospheres and interiors of exoplanets and have developed a deeper understanding of processes of planet formation and evolution. However, we have yet to map out the full complexity of multi-planet architectures or to detect Earth analogues around nearby stars. Reaching these ambitious goals will require further improvements in instrumentation and new analysis tools. In this chapter, we provide an overview of five observational techniques that are currently employed in the detection of exoplanets: optical and IR Doppler measurements, transit photometry, direct imaging, microlensing, and astrometry. We provide a basic description of how each of these techniques works and discuss forefront developments that will result in new discoveries. We also highlight the observational limitations and synergies of each method and their connections to future space missions.},

abstract = {Terrestrial exoplanets in the canonical habitable zone may have a variety of initial water fractions due to random volatile delivery by planetesimals. If the total planetary water complement is high, the entire surface may be covered in water, forming a "waterworld." On a planet with active tectonics, competing mechanisms act to regulate the abundance of water on the surface by determining the partitioning of water between interior and surface. Here we explore how the incorporation of different mechanisms for the degassing and regassing of water changes the volatile evolution of a planet. For all of the models considered, volatile cycling reaches an approximate steady-state after {\$}\backslashsim 2 \backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}Gyr{\}}{\$}. Using these steady-states, we find that if volatile cycling is either solely dependent on temperature or seafloor pressure, exoplanets require a high abundance ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 0.3\backslash{\%}{\$} of total mass) of water to have fully inundated surfaces. However, if degassing is more dependent on seafloor pressure and regassing mainly dependent on mantle temperature, the degassing rate is relatively large at late times and a steady-state between degassing and regassing is reached with a substantial surface water fraction. If this hybrid model is physical, super-Earths with a total water fraction similar to that of the Earth can become waterworlds. As a result, further understanding of the processes that drive volatile cycling on terrestrial planets is needed to determine the water fraction at which they are likely to become waterworlds.},

Habitability has been traditionally defined in terms of an orbital semimajor axis within a range known as the habitable zone, but it is also well known that the habitability of Earth is due to many other astrophysical, geological, and geochemical factors. We focus this review on (1) recent refinements to habitable zone calculations; (2) the formation and orbital stability of terrestrial planets; (3) the tempo and mode of geologic activity (e.g., plate tectonics) on terrestrial planets; (4) the delivery of water to terrestrial planets in the habitable zone; and (5) the acquisition and loss of terrestrial planet carbon and nitrogen, elements that constitute important atmospheric gases responsible for habitable conditions on Earth's surface as well as being the building blocks of the biosphere itself. Finally, we consider recent work on evidence for the earliest habitable environments and the appearance of life itself on our planet. Such evidence provides us with an important, if nominal, calibration point for our search for other habitable worlds.},

abstract = {Many exoplanets have been discovered with radii of 1-4 Earth radii, between that of Earth and Neptune. A number of these are known to have densities consistent with solid compositions, while others are "sub-Neptunes" likely to have significant hydrogen-helium envelopes. Future surveys will no doubt significantly expand these populations. In order to understand how the measured masses and radii of such planets can inform their structures and compositions, we construct models both for solid layered planets and for planets with solid cores and gaseous envelopes, exploring a range of core masses, hydrogen-helium envelope masses, and associated envelope entropies. For planets in the super-Earth/sub-Neptune regime for which both radius and mass are measured, we estimate how each is partitioned into a solid core and gaseous envelope, associating a specific core mass and envelope mass with a given exoplanet. We perform this decomposition for both "Earth-like" rock-iron cores and pure ice cores, and find that the necessary gaseous envelope masses for this important sub-class of exoplanets must range very widely from zero to many Earth masses, even for a given core mass. This result bears importantly on exoplanet formation and envelope evaporation processes.},

We find good agreement between the mass retrieved for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b from transmission spectroscopy with that from RV measurements.

@article{Wagner2011,
abstract = {The detection of low-mass extrasolar planets has initiated growing interest in massive rocky bodies (super-Earths) for which no Solar System analogue does exist. Here, we present a new model approach to investigate their interior structure and thermal state. We improve and extend previous interior models mainly in two areas: the first improvement is due to the consequent application of equations of state (EoS) that are compliant with the thermodynamics of the high-pressure limit and facilitate reinvestigating mass–radius relations for terrestrial-type exoplanets. To quantify the uncertainty due to extrapolation, we compare a generalized Rydberg and a Keane EoS, which are both consistent with the high-pressure limit. Furthermore, we consider a reciprocal K′ EoS that fits the seismologically obtained Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), thereby accounting for the mineralogical composition of the Earth. As a result, the predicted planetary radii of terrestrial-type exoplanets of up to 10 Earth masses would differ by less than 2{\%} between all three EoS, well within current observational limits. The second extension arises from the adoption of a mixing length formulation instead of the commonly used, more simplified parameterized approach to model convective heat transport in planetary mantles. In comparison to parameterized convection models, our results indicate generally hotter interiors with increasing planetary mass and a cumulative tendency to extended regimes of sluggish convection in the lowermost mantle. The latter is attributed to less efficient convective heat transport with increasing mantle pressures. An improved knowledge of the present thermal state is prerequisite to gain a better understanding of the pathways of internal evolution of terrestrial-type exoplanets.},

abstract = {Latent heat release by equilibrium mineralogical transformations in an adiabatically subducting slab reversibly perturbs temperatures and pressures so as to conserve entropy. However, latent heats of metastable transformations in such a slab yield irreversible isobaric temperature changes which increase entropy despite adiabatic constraints. As a result, latent heat release by metastable exothermic transformations can yield local superheating above the background adiabat, with the degree of potential superheating increasing with extent of metastable overstep. In real slabs, however, regions of metastably persisting low-pressure phases should undergo conductive warming from surrounding transformed material. Such warming should proceed more rapidly than warming of the bulk slab from the surrounding mantle, and the resulting decrease in metastable transition pressures will slightly decrease the degree of local superheating. Nonetheless, such local temperature increases may trigger seismic release of accumulated strain energy via a number of proposed mechanisms of shear instability. Adiabatic instability, in the form of shear localization in material with temperature-dependent rheology, is one mechanism which may be triggered by such latent heat release in metastable regions yet produce rupture that extends beyond the boundaries of such regions.},

abstract = {We obtained spectra in the wavelength range $\lambda$ = 995-1769 nm of all four known planets orbiting the star HR 8799. Using the suite of instrumentation known as Project 1640 on the Palomar 5 m Hale Telescope, we acquired data at two epochs. This allowed for multiple imaging detections of the companions and multiple extractions of low-resolution (R {\~{}} 35) spectra. Data reduction employed two different methods of speckle suppression and spectrum extraction, both yielding results that agree. The spectra do not directly correspond to those of any known objects, although similarities with L and T dwarfs are present, as well as some characteristics similar to planets such as Saturn. We tentatively identify the presence of CH4 along with NH3 and/or C2H2, and possibly CO2 or HCN in varying amounts in each component of the system. Other studies suggested red colors for these faint companions, and our data confirm those observations. Cloudy models, based on previous photometric observations, may provide the best explanation for the new data presented here. Notable in our data is that these presumably co-eval objects of similar luminosity have significantly different spectra; the diversity of planets may be greater than previously thought. The techniques and methods employed in this paper represent a new capability to observe and rapidly characterize exoplanetary systems in a routine manner over a broad range of planet masses and separations. These are the first simultaneous spectroscopic observations of multiple planets in a planetary system other than our own.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of super-Earths (masses {\textless}=10 M⊕) has initiated a discussion about conditions for habitable worlds. Among these is the mode of convection, which influences a planet's thermal evolution and surface conditions. On Earth, plate tectonics has been proposed as a necessary condition for life. Here we show that super-Earths will also have plate tectonics. We demonstrate that as planetary mass increases, the shear stress available to overcome resistance to plate motion increases while the plate thickness decreases, thereby enhancing plate weakness. These effects contribute favorably to the subduction of the lithosphere, an essential component of plate tectonics. Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate tectonics in the 1 M⊕ regime disappear as mass increases: super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behavior.},

We discuss the current state of knowledge about the equations of state (EOS) that influence these calculations and the improvements used in the new grid. For the two-layer model, we demonstrate the utility of contours on the mass–radius diagrams. Given the mass and radius input, these contours can be used to quickly determine the important physical properties of a planet including its p0p0 (central pressure), p1/p0p1/p0 (core–mantle boundary pressure over central pressure), CMF (core mass fraction) or CRF (core radius fraction).

A primordial C/O greater than 0.8 causes a carbide-dominated interior, as opposed to the silicate-dominated composition found on Earth; the atmosphere can also differ from those in the Solar System. The solar C/O is 0.54 (ref. 3). Here we report an analysis of dayside multi-wavelength photometry of the transiting hot-Jupiter WASP-12b (ref. 6) that reveals C/O ≥ 1 in its atmosphere. The atmosphere is abundant in CO. It is depleted in water vapour and enhanced in methane, each by more than two orders of magnitude compared to a solar-abundance chemical-equilibrium model at the expected temperatures. We also find that the extremely irradiated atmosphere (T {\textgreater} 2,500 K) of WASP-12b lacks a prominent thermal inversion (or stratosphere) and has very efficient day-night energy circulation. The absence of a strong thermal inversion is in stark contrast to theoretical predictions for the most highly irradiated hot-Jupiter atmospheres.},

It combines a very high-order adaptive optics system, a diffraction-suppressing coronagraph, and an integral field spectrograph with low spectral resolution but high spatial resolution. Every aspect of the Gemini Planet Imager has been tuned for maximum sensitivity to faint planets near bright stars. During first-light observations, we achieved an estimated H band Strehl ratio of 0.89 and a 5-$\sigma$ contrast of 10(6) at 0.75 arcseconds and 10(5) at 0.35 arcseconds. Observations of Beta Pictoris clearly detect the planet, Beta Pictoris b, in a single 60-s exposure with minimal postprocessing. Beta Pictoris b is observed at a separation of 434 ± 6 milliarcseconds (mas) and position angle 211.8 ± 0.5°. Fitting the Keplerian orbit of Beta Pic b using the new position together with previous astrometry gives a factor of 3 improvement in most parameters over previous solutions.

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC (approximately less than) 13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

abstract = {In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) adopted a new formulation called “The IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use”, which we abbreviate to IAPWS-95 formulation or IAPWS-95 for short. This IAPWS-95 formulation replaces the previous formulation adopted in 1984. This work provides information on the selected experimental data of the thermodynamic properties of water used to develop the new formulation, but information is also given on newer data. The article presents all details of the IAPWS-95 formulation, which is in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. The function for the residual part of the Helmholtz free energy was fitted to selected data for the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single-phase region (p$\rho$T) and of the vapor–liquid phase boundary (p $\sigma$ $\rho$ ′ $\rho$ ″ T), including the phase-equilibrium condition (Maxwell criterion), and (b) the caloric properties specific isochoric heat capacity, specific isobaric heat capacity,speed of sound, differences in the specific enthalpy and in the specific internal energy, Joule–Thomson coefficient, and isothermal throttling coefficient. By applying modern strategies for optimizing the functional form of the equation of state and for the simultaneous nonlinear fitting to the data of all mentioned properties, the resulting IAPWS-95 formulation covers a validity range for temperatures from the melting line (lowest temperature 251.2 K at 209.9 MPa) to 1273 K and pressures up to 1000 MPa. In this entire range of validity, IAPWS-95 represents even the most accurate data to within their experimental uncertainty. In the most important part of the liquid region, the estimated uncertainty of IAPWS-95 ranges from ±0.001{\%} to ±0.02{\%} in density, ±0.03{\%} to ±0.2{\%} in speed of sound, and ±0.1{\%} in isobaric heat capacity. In the liquid region at ambient pressure, IAPWS-95 is extremely accurate in density (uncertainty ⩽±0.0001{\%}) and in speed of sound (±0.005{\%}). In a large part of the gas region the estimated uncertainty in density ranges from ±0.03{\%} to ±0.05{\%}, in speed of sound it amounts to ±0.15{\%} and in isobaric heat capacity it is ±0.2{\%}. In the critical region, IAPWS-95 represents not only the thermal properties very well but also the caloric properties in a reasonable way. Special interest has been focused on the extrapolation behavior of the new formulation. At least for the basic properties such as pressure and enthalpy, IAPWS-95 can be extrapolated up to extremely high pressures and temperatures. In addition to the IAPWS-95 formulation, independent equations for vapor pressure, the densities, and the most important caloric properties along the vapor–liquid phase boundary, and for the pressure on the melting and sublimation curve, are given. Moreover, a so-called gas equation for densities up to 55 kg   m −3 is also included. Tables of the thermodynamic properties calculated from the IAPWS-95 formulation are listed in the Appendix.},

abstract = {We report high-precision spectrophotometric observations of four planetary transits of HD 209458, in the region of the sodium resonance doublet at 589.3 nm. We find that the photometric dimming during transit in a bandpass centered on the sodium feature is deeper by (2.32 ± 0.57) × 10-4 relative to simultaneous observations of the transit in adjacent bands. We interpret this additional dimming as absorption from sodium in the planetary atmosphere, as recently predicted from several theoretical modeling efforts. Our model for a cloudless planetary atmosphere with a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form predicts more sodium absorption than we observe. There are several possibilities that may account for this reduced amplitude, including reaction of atomic sodium into molecular gases and/or condensates, photoionization of sodium by the stellar flux, a low primordial abundance of sodium, and the presence of clouds high in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Various thermodynamic equilibrium properties of naturally abundant, hexagonal ice(ice Ih) of water ( H 2 O ) have been used to develop a Gibbs energy function g(T,p) of temperature and pressure, covering the ranges 0–273.16 K and 0 Pa–210 MPa, expressed in the temperature scale ITS-90. It serves as a fundamental equation from which additional properties are obtained as partial derivatives by thermodynamic rules. Extending previously developed Gibbs functions, it covers the entire existence region of ice Ih in the T-p diagram. Close to zero temperature, it obeys the theoretical cubic limiting law of Debye for heat capacity and Pauling's residual entropy. It is based on a significantly enlarged experimental data set compared to its predecessors. Due to the inherent thermodynamic cross relations, the formulas for particular quantities like density, thermal expansion, or compressibility are thus fully consistent with each other, are more reliable now, and extended in their ranges of validity. In conjunction with the IAPWS-95 formulation for the fluid phases of water, the new chemical potential of ice allows an alternative computation of the melting and sublimation curves, being improved especially near the triple point, and valid down to 130 K sublimation temperature. It provides an absolute entropy reference value for liquid water at the triple point.},

abstract = {A first characterization of extrasolar planets by the observational determination of the radius has recently been achieved for a large number of planets. For some planets, a measurement of the luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly im- aged planets expected in the near future. The statistical characterization of exoplanets through their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is becoming possible. This is for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as the mass-distance diagram. Our aim is to extend our planet-formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. We want to calculate from one single model in a self-consistent way all basic quantities describing a planet: its mass, semimajor axis, composition, radius, and luminosity.We then want to use this model for population synthesis calculations. In this and a companion paper, we show how we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope of a pro- toplanet during the early-formation phase, the gas runaway accretion phase, and the evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales.We improve the model further with a new prescription for the disk-limited gas accretion rate, an internal structure model for the planetary core assuming a differentiated interior, and the inclusion of radioactive decay as an additional heat source in the core. We study the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of giant planets, the influence of the core mass on the radius, and the luminosity both in the “hot start” and the “cold start” scenario. Special emphasis is placed on the validation of the model by comparing it with other models of planet formation and evolution.We find that our results agree very well with those of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications we make in our calculations. The upgraded model yields the most important physical quantities describing a planet from its beginning as a tiny seed embryo to a Gyr-old planet. This is the case for all planets in a synthetic planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self- consistently the observational constraints coming from all major observational techniques. This is important in a time where different techniques yield constraints on very diverse sub-populations of planets, and where it is difficult to put all these constraints together in one coherent picture. Our comprehensive formation and evolution model should be helpful in this situation for the understanding of exoplanets.},

abstract = {Tidal heating in Enceladus is investigated using multilayered viscoelastic models of the satellite. Dissipation in a homogeneous Maxwell model of Enceladus at the current eccentricity can be as large as 920 GW, nearly a factor of 2000 greater than previously thought, reflecting the fact that the dynamic Love number can approach unity the elastic Love number ∼10−3. The theoretical tidal heating maximum violates an upper bound based on Saturn's Q and models with this much heating are unreasonable. Plausible multilayered models are shown to be thermally stable at the current eccentricity with ∼10 km thick lithosphere and surface heat flow ∼5 mW m−2; the models require a combination of near-surface insulation, subsurface solar heating, or anomalously low lithosphere conductivity to simultaneously fit dynamic and geologic constraints. A two-layer model with a conductive lithosphere over a Maxwell mantle has mantle viscosity of about 1013 Pa sec and mantle temperature about 210°K. A three-layer model with an internal ocean of accumulated NH3 {\textperiodcentered} H2O eutectic melt that decouples the lithosphere from a Maxwell core has slightly lower internal viscosity and slightly higher temperature than the two-layer model. Dissipation in the ocean layer may be significant if the tidally forced flow is turbulent. The models suggest that Enceladus' thermal and dynamical evolution may have been relatively simple, involving only Dione in a 2:1 resonance. The current eccentricity could have been maintained since resonance onset with recurring surface activity due to a thermally active interior.},

abstract = {Recently it has been argued, based on theoretical calculations and experimental data, that there is a universal form for the equation of state of solids. This observation was restricted to the range of temperatures and pressures such that there are no phase transitions. The use of this universal relation to estimate pressure-volume relations (i.e., isotherms) required three input parameters at each fixed temperature. In this paper we show that for many solids the input data needed to predict high-temperature thermodynamical properties can be dramatically reduced. In particular, only four numbers are needed: (1) the zero pressure (P=0) isothermal bulk modulus, (2) its P=0 pressure derivative, (3) the P=0 volume, and (4) the P=0 thermal expansion; all evaluated at a single (reference) temperature. Explicit predictions are made for the high-temperature isotherms, the thermal expansion as a function of temperature, and the temperature variation of the isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. These predictions are tested using experimental data for three representative solids: gold, sodium chloride, and xenon. Good agreement between theory and experiment is found.},

This allows us to determine the bulk elemental composition of simulated extrasolar terrestrial planets.

abstract = {Several transiting super-Earths are expected to be discovered in the coming few years. While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found.},

abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometric time series of the transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-1. The data span a predicted time of secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star. In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing, amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system. This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e., the observation of photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths (in units of relative flux) are 0.00066 ± 0.00013 at 4.5 $\mu$m and 0.00225 ± 0.00036 at 8.0 $\mu$m. These estimates provide the first observational constraints on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of Tp = 1060 ± 50 K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo of A = 0.31 ± 0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to atmospheric models of these objects. We also compare our data to a previously published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon monoxide. This model adequately reproduces the observed planet-to-star flux ratio at 8.0 $\mu$m; however, it significantly overpredicts the ratio at 4.5 $\mu$m. We also present an estimate of the timing of the secondary eclipse, which we use to place a strong constraint on the expression e cos $\omega$, where e is the orbital eccentricity and $\omega$ is the longitude of periastron. The resulting upper limit on e is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to the planet.},

In this paper a comprehensive evaluation of the resulting thermodynamic data is given including comparison with other theories and shock‐wave data.},

abstract = {The detection and atmospheric characterization of super-Earths is one of the major frontiers of exoplanetary science. Currently, extensive efforts are underway to detect molecules, particularly H2O, in super-Earth atmospheres. In the present work, we develop a systematic set of strategies to identify and observe potentially H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. Firstly, we provide analytic prescriptions and discuss factors that need to be taken into account while planning and interpreting observations of super-Earth radii and spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses constrain different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and temperature of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the chemical composition and thermal profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses can induce biases in the interpretation of the interior compositions. Secondly, we investigate the detectability of H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the HST WFC3 spectrograph as a function of the planetary properties and stellar brightness. We find that highly irradiated super-Earths orbiting bright stars, such as 55 Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization compared to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars. Besides being better candidates for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, hotter planets offer higher likelihood of cloud-free atmospheres which aid tremendously in the observation and interpretation of spectra. Finally, we present case studies of two super-Earths, GJ 1214b and 55 Cancri e, using available data and models of their interiors and atmospheres.},

abstract = {The interior of giant planets can give valuable information on formation and evolution processes of planetary systems. However, the interior and evolution of Uranus and Neptune is still largely unknown. In this paper, we compare water-rich three-layer structure models of these planets with predictions of shell structures derived from magnetic field models. Uranus and Neptune have unusual non-dipolar magnetic fields contrary to that of the Earth. Extensive three-dimensional simulations of Stanley and Bloxham (Stanley, S., Bloxham, J. [2004]. Nature 428, 151–153) have indicated that such a magnetic field is generated in a rather thin shell of at most 0.3 planetary radii located below the H/He rich outer envelope and a conducting core that is fluid but stably stratified. Interior models rely on equation of state data for the planetary materials which have usually considerable uncertainties in the high-pressure domain. We present interior models for Uranus and Neptune that are based on ab initio equation of state data for hydrogen, helium, and water as the representative of all heavier elements or ices. Based on a detailed high-pressure phase diagram of water we can specify the region where superionic water should occur in the inner envelope. This superionic region correlates well with the location of the stably-stratified region as found in the dynamo models. Hence we suggest a significant impact of the phase diagram of water on the generation of the magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.},

We explore which aspects of bulk terrestrial planet composition and interior structure affect the chief observables of an exoplanet: its mass and radius. We apply these perturbations to the Earth, the planet we know best. Using the mineral physics toolkit BurnMan to self-consistently calculate mass-radius models, we find that core radius, presence of light elements in the core and an upper-mantle consisting of low-pressure silicates have the largest effect on the final calculated mass at a given radius, with mantle composition being secondary. We further apply this model to determine the interior composition of Kepler-36b, finding that it is likely structurally similar to the Earth with Si/Fe = 1.14 compared to Earth's Si/Fe = 1 and Sun's Si/Fe = 1.19. We expand these results provide a grid of terrestrial mass-radius models for determining whether exoplanets are indeed "Earth-like" as bound by their composition and structure.},

When smoothed to 75 nm bins, the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15 um and 1.4 um water vapor features respectively are 83+/-53 ppm and 200+/-47 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 um. We compare the WFC3 spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD 189733b assembled by Pont et al. (2013), extending from 0.3 um to 24 um. Although the water vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere (Pont et al. 2013), we also re-interpret the available data with a clear planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the visible and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model planetary atmosphere's temperature is {\~{}}700 K, which is below the condensation temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad wings of the spectral lines of Na I and K I at 0.589 um and 0.769 um to be weak.},

@article{Sotin2007,
abstract = {By comparison with the Earth-like planets and the large icy satellites of the Solar System, one can model the internal structure of extrasolar planets. The input parameters are the composition of the star (Fe/Si and Mg/Si), the Mg content of the mantle (Mg{\#} = Mg/[Mg + Fe]), the amount of H 2O and the total mass of the planet. Equation of State (EoS) of the different materials that are likely to be present within such planets have been obtained thanks to recent progress in high-pressure experiments. They are used to compute the planetary radius as a function of the total mass. Based on accretion models and data on planetary differentiation, the internal structure is likely to consist of an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle and an outer silicate crust resulting from magma formation in the mantle. The amount of H 2O and the surface temperature control the possibility for these planets to harbor an ocean. In preparation to the interpretation of the forthcoming data from the CNES led CoRoT (Convection Rotation and Transit) mission and from ground-based observations, this paper investigates the relationship between radius and mass. If H 2O is not an important component (less than 0.1{\%}) of the total mass of the planet, then a relation (R/R)=a( is calculated with (a,b)=(1,0.306) and (a,b)=(1,0.274) for 10M{\textless}M{\textless}M and M{\textless}M{\textless}10M, respectively. Calculations for a planet that contains 50{\%} H 2O suggest that the radius would be more than 25{\%} larger than that based on the Earth-like model, with (a,b)=(1.258,0.302) for 10M{\textless}M{\textless}M and (a,b)=(1.262,0.275) for M{\textless}M{\textless}10M, respectively. For a surface temperature of 300 K, the thickness of the ocean varies from 150 to 50 km for planets 1 to 10 times the Earth's mass, respectively. Application of this algorithm to bodies of the Solar System provides not only a good fit to most terrestrial planets and large icy satellites, but also insights for discussing future observations of exoplanets.},

For the initial evolution in phase i), we carried out N-body simulations of the systems consisting of three jupiter-mass planets taking into account the dynamical tide. The formation rate of the binary planets is as much as 10{\%} of the systems that undergo orbital crossing and this fraction is almost independent of the initial stellarcentric semi-major axes of the planets, while ejection and merging rates sensitively depend on the semi-major axes. As a result of circularization by the planet-planet dynamical tide, typical binary separations are a few times the sum of the physical radii of the planets. After the orbital circularization, the evolution of the binary system is governed by long-term quasi-static tide. We analytically calculated the quasi-static tidal evolution in later phase ii). The binary planets first enter the spin-orbit synchronous state by the planet-planet tide. The planet-star tide removes angular momentum of the binary motion, eventually resulting in a collision between the planets. However, we found that the binary planets survive the tidal decay for main-sequence life time of solar-type stars ({\~{}}10Gyrs), if the binary planets are beyond {\~{}}0.3 AU from the central stars. These results suggest that the binary planets can be detected by transit observations at {\textgreater}0.3AU.},

abstract = {The correlation energy of the electron gas is treated as a perturbation on the total free energy computed for the zero-temperature Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) model of a solid. The contribution to the free energy is computed on the basis of two extreme assumptions: (i) The correlation energy is considered to be a local function of position inside the Wigner-Seitz sphere; and (ii) correlation forces are sufficiently long range so that the correlation part of the free energy is determined only by the average electron density. It is argued that (ii) is the more valid approach in the region of normal metallic densities. In terms of the parameter sa0, the radius of a sphere occupied by a single electron, an interpolation formula is developed for the correlation energy in the intermediate region between s≪1 (degenerate electron gas) and s∼60 (electron lattice-fluid phase transition). At extremely high densities, a series expansion in s is used to obtain an analytic expression for the electron pressure up to terms of order s3. For these high densities, prescriptions (i) and (ii) are equivalent. At lower densities, numerical results are presented for an assortment of elements for the TFD model, and TFD with correlations based on (i) and (ii). These are compared with shock-wave and seismic data, and the average correlation contribution computed from (ii) is found to be in better agreement than the other two procedures. A semiempirical formula is presented, which fits the numerical data to better than 0.5{\%} for all pressures and atomic numbers, and reduces to the correct expression in the high-density limit. From this semiempirical formula, pressure-density curves are obtained for a variety of elements and minerals which have been considered as likely constituents of the core and mantle of the earth. A table of effective atomic numbers, to be used in the semiempirical formula, is given for the minerals.},

abstract = {GJ 1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ 1214b is at most 7{\%} by mass. In general, we find the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c, and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10{\%} H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10{\%}-18{\%} and 5{\%}-15{\%} bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that although a 100{\%} water composition fits the data for GJ 1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. The same is true for Kepler-11f. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ 1214b will help determine the extent of compositional segregation between the atmosphere and the envelope.},

These systems are central to many areas of scientific study and industrial application, including electric power generation, industrial steam systems, hydrothermal processing of materials, geochemistry, and environmental applications. The authors' goal is to present the material at a level that serves both the graduate student seeking to learn the state of the art, and also the industrial engineer or chemist seeking to develop additional expertise or to find the data needed to solve a specific problem.The wide range of people for whom this topic is important provides a challenge. Advanced work in this area is distributed among physical chemists, chemical engineers, geochemists, and other specialists, who may not be aware of parallel work by those outside their own specialty. The particular aspects of high-temperature aqueous physical chemistry of interest to one industry may be irrelevant to another; yet another industry might need the same basic information but in a very different form.To serve all these constituencies, the book includes several chapters that cover the foundational thermophysical properties (such as gas solubility, phase behavior, thermodynamic properties of solutes, and transport properties) that are of interest across numerous applications. The presentation of these topics is intended to be accessible to readers from a variety of backgrounds. Other chapters address fundamental areas of more specialized interest, such as critical phenomena and molecular-level solution structure. Several chapters are more application-oriented, addressing areas such as power-cycle chemistry and hydrothermal synthesis. As befits the variety of interests addressed, some chapters provide more theoretical guidance while others, such as those on acid/base equilibria and the solubilities of metal oxides and hydroxides, emphasize experimental techniques and data analysis.- Covers both the theory and applications of all Hydrothermal solutions - Provides an accessible, up-to-date overview of important aspects of the physical chemistry of aqueous systems at high temperatures and pressures- The presentation of the book is understandable to readers from a variety of backgrounds},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the bulk composition of the MEarth transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b using planet interior structure models. We consider three possible origins for the gas layer on GJ 1214b: direct accretion of gas from the protoplanetary nebula, sublimation of ices, and outgassing from rocky material. Armed only with measurements of the planet mass (Mp = 6.55 ± 0.98 M ⊕), radius (Rp = 2.678 ± 0.13 R ⊕), and stellar irradiation level, our main conclusion is that we cannot infer a unique composition. A diverse range of planet interiors fits the measured planet properties. Nonetheless, GJ 1214b's relatively low average density ($\rho$ p = 1870 ± 400 kg m-3) means that it almost certainly has a significant gas component. Our second major conclusion is that under most conditions we consider GJ 1214b would not have liquid water. Even if the outer envelope is predominantly sublimated water ice, the envelope will likely consist of a super-fluid layer sandwiched between vapor above and plasma (electrically conductive fluid) below at greater depths. In our models, a low intrinsic planet luminosity (lsim2TW) is needed for a water envelope on GJ 1214b to pass through the liquid phase.},

abstract = {The configurational entropy of several H-disordered ice polymorphs is calculated by means of a thermodynamic integration along a path between a totally H-disordered state and one fulfilling the Bernal-Fowler ice rules. A Monte Carlo procedure based on a simple energy model is used, so that the employed thermodynamic path drives the system from high temperatures to the low-temperature limit. This method turns out to be precise enough to give reliable values for the configurational entropy of different ice phases in the thermodynamic limit (number of molecules N --{\textgreater} infinity). The precision of the method is checked for the ice model on a two-dimensional square lattice. Results for the configurational entropy are given for H-disordered arrangements on several polymorphs, including ices Ih, Ic, II, III, IV, V, VI, and XII. The highest and lowest entropy values correspond to ices VI and XII, respectively, with a difference of 3.3$\backslash${\%} between them. The dependence of the entropy on the ice structures has been rationalized by comparing it with structural parameters of the various polymorphs, such as the mean ring size. A particularly good correlation has been found between the configurational entropy and the connective constant derived from self-avoiding walks on the ice networks.},

abstract = {The study presented here sought to determine the PVT properties of Ice VII at elevated temperatures and pressures up to 60 GPa using a Mao-Bell type diamond anvil cell with an external Mo-wire resistance heater. The unit cells of Ice VII and gold were monitored during the experiment with gold being used as an internal pressure calibrant. Additionally, the melting curve of Ice VII was determined to greater than 40 GPa by using the disappearance of the diffraction pattern of Ice VII to monitor melting in the system. The melting curve for Ice VII from 3 to 60 GPa was found to be accurately related by a Simon equation: (P−2.17)0.764= T3554.32−1 where pressure and temperature are denoted by P (GPa) and T (kelvin), respectively. These results were used further to constrain the PVT properties of fluid H2O at elevated pressures and temperatures by taking the pressure derivative of the Gibbs free energy difference between Ice VII and fluid H2O along the Ice VII melting curve. Comparison of these results suggests that the previously stated equations of state of fluid H2O overestimate the molar volume of fluid H2O at pressures greater than 20 GPa. Although the data presented in this study is not enough to provide an independent EOS for fluid H2O, future work should take account of our data.},

abstract = {Extrasolar planets as light as a few Earth masses are now being detected. Such planets are likely not gas or ice giants. Here, we present a study on the possible properties of the small and cold extrasolar planets, applied to the case of the recently discovered planet OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb. This planet (5.5 M⊕) orbits 2.6 AU away from an old M-type star of the Galactic bulge. The planet should be entirely frozen given the low surface temperature (35-47 K). However, depending on the rock-to-ice mass ratio in the planet, the radiogenic heating could be sufficient to make the existence of liquid water within an icy crust possible. This possibility is estimated as a function of the planetary mass and the illumination received from the parent star, both being strongly related by the observational constraints. The results are presented for water-poor and water-rich planets. We find that no oceans can be present in any cases at 9-10 Gyr, a typical age for a star of the bulge. However, we find that in the past, when the planet was 5 Gyr old, liquid water was likely present below an icy surface. Nevertheless, the planet is now likely to be entirely frozen.},

To cool a sample below the melting point requires some time, as does nucleation from the metastable liquid1 freezing usually occurs over many seconds2 ,so . Freezing conditions can be createdmuch more quickly using isentropic compression techniques, which provide insight into the limiting timescales of the phase transition. Here, we show that water rapidly freezes without a nucleator under sufficient compression, establishing a practical limit for the metastable liquid phase. Above 7GPa, compressed water completely transforms to a high-pressure phase within a few nanoseconds. The consistent observation of freezing with different samples and container materials suggests that the transition nucleates homogeneously. The observation of complete freezing on these timescales further implies that the liquid reaches a hypercooled state3 .},

abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K{\textgreater}30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3{\%} of stars with -0.5{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]{\textgreater}+0.3 dex, 25{\%} of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form $\rho$=$\rho$0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5{\%} fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with {\~{}}5{\%} uncertainty water ice planets with {\textgreater}{\~{}}25{\%} water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state.

abstract = {Detecting the atmospheres of low-mass low-temperature exoplanets is a high-priority goal on the path to ultimately detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets. High-precision HST observations of several super-Earths with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K have to date all resulted in featureless transmission spectra, which have been suggested to be due to high-altitude clouds. We report the detection of an atmospheric feature in the atmosphere of a 1.6 Mearth transiting exoplanet, GJ 1132b, with an equilibrium temperature of {\~{}}600 K and orbiting a nearby M dwarf. We present observations of nine transits of the planet obtained simultaneously in the griz and JHK passbands. We find an average radius of 1.44 +/- 0.21 Rearth for the planet, averaged over all the passbands, which can be decomposed into a "surface radius" at {\~{}}1.35 Rearth, and higher contributions in the z and K bands. The z-band radius is 4 sigma higher than the continuum, suggesting a strong detection of an atmosphere. We deploy a suite of tests to verify the reliability of the transmission spectrum, which are greatly helped by the existence of repeat observations. The large z-band transit depth indicates strong opacity from H2O and/or CH4 or an hitherto unconsidered opacity. A surface radius of 1.35 +/- 0.21 Rearth allows for a wide range of interior compositions ranging from a nearly Earth-like rocky interior, with {\~{}}70{\%} silicate and {\~{}}30{\%} Fe, to a substantially H2O-rich water world. New observations with HST and existing ground-based facilities would be able to confirm the present detection and further constrain the atmospheric composition of the planet.},

We find a surface gravity of gp= 9.28 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.15 m s-2, which is an order of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its mass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower surface gravity than that predicted by published theoretical models of gas giant planets.

abstract = {We present models of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus which exactly match recent accurate determinations of these planets' gravitational harmonics. The models are computed to third order in the rotational disturbance to the total potential and are based upon a method for inverting the gravitational data. For Jupiter and Saturn, a range of gravity models is calculated to test the possibility of a reduction of density in the outer layers due to helium depletion. The results, which are based upon an improved equation of state for molecular hydrogen, indicate that major helium depletion has not occurred in the outer (molecular hydrogen) layers of Jupiter or Saturn, or if it has, that its effect on the density profile is masked by the presence of other, denser, components. Jupiter is found to be slightly enhanced in heavy elements with respect to solar composition, but the density profile of its hydrogen-rich layers generally agrees rather well with a theoretical profile for solar composition. The deviations from such a profile are more pronounced in the case of Saturn. Uranus models have considerable uncertainty; one successful model resembles the ice-rich model of M. Podolak and R.T. Reynolds (1987, Icarus 70, 31–36), but is fitted to a newer value of J4. Our Uranus model has a substantial enrichment of heavy elements at depth, but little separation of the ice from the rock component. All of the Jovian planets appear to have central cores of non-hydrogen-helium material which are of similar mass (about 10–15 Earth masses). For Jupiter and Saturn, our calculations yield a gravitational harmonic J6 which is in agreement with observation, but suggest that this quantity, along with harmonics of higher degree and order, is likely to be more useful for constraining the nature of fluid currents in outer layers rather than deep static structure.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code AREPO, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.},

Based on recent studies, it is expected that a significant proportion of host stars may have Mg/Si ratios below 1. Here we examine this previously neglected group of systems. Planets simulated as forming within these systems are found to be Mg-depleted (compared to Earth), consisting of silicate species such as pyroxene and various feldspars. Planetary carbon abundances also vary in accordance with the host star C/O ratio.

abstract = {The planet GJ 1214b is the second known super-Earth with a measured mass and radius. Orbiting a quiet M star, it receives considerably less mass-loss driving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b, so that the interior may be quite dissimilar in composition, including the possibility of a large fraction of water. We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock core) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a mixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework, we perform models of the thermal evolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that are consistent with Mp = 6.55 M ⊕, Rp = 2.678 R ⊕, an age $\tau$ = 3-10 Gyr, and the irradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water exists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important consequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the atmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar, depending on composition. Our results bolster the suggestion of a metal-enriched H/He atmosphere for the planet, as we find water-world models that lack an H/He atmosphere to require an implausibly large water-to-rock ratio of more than 6:1. We instead favor an H/He/H2O envelope with high water mass fraction ({\~{}}0.5-0.85), similar to recent models of the deep envelope of Uranus and Neptune. Even with these high water mass fractions in the H/He envelope, generally the bulk composition of the planet can have subsolar water:rock ratios. Dry, water-enriched, and pure water envelope models differ to an observationally significant level in their tidal Love numbers k 2 of, respectively, {\~{}}0.018, {\~{}}0.15, and {\~{}}0.7.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries of water-rich, sub-Neptunian to Neptunian-massed exoplanets with short-period orbits present a new parameter space for the study of exoplanetary dynamos. We explore the geometry of the dynamo source region within this parameter space using 1-D interior structure models. We model planets with 4 chemically distinct layers that consist of (1) an iron core, (2) a silicate layer, (3) an H2O layer, and (4) an H/He envelope. By varying the total planetary mass in the range of 1 - 19 Earth masses, the mass fraction of the H/He envelope between 0.1 - 5.1{\%}, and the equilibrium temperature between 100 - 1000 K, a survey of the parameter space for potential dynamo source region geometries is conducted. We find that due to the nature of the phase diagram of water at pressure and temperature conditions of planetary interiors, two different dynamo source region geometries are obtainable. Specifically, we find that smaller planets and planets with thicker H/He envelopes are likely to be in the regime of a thick-shelled dynamo. Massive planets and planets with thin H/He envelopes are likely to be in the regime of a thin-shelled dynamo. Also, small variations of these parameters can produce large interior structure differences. This implies the potential to constrain these parameters based on observations of a planet's magnetic field signature.},

abstract = {Amongst the many hundreds of transiting planet candidates discovered by the Kepler mission, one finds a large number of candidates with sizes between that of the Earth and Neptune. The composition of these worlds is not immediately obvious with no Solar system analogue to draw upon and there exists some ambiguity as to whether a given candidate is a rocky super-Earth or a gas-enveloped mini-Neptune. The potential scientific value and observability of the atmospheres of these two classes of worlds varies significantly, and given the sheer number of candidates in this size range, there is evidently a need for a quick, simple metric to rank whether the planets have an extended atmosphere or not. In this work, we propose a way to calculate the `minimum atmospheric height' (RMAH) using only a planet's radius and mass as inputs. We assume and exploit the boundary condition that the bulk composition of a solid/liquid super-Earth cannot be composed of a material lighter than that of water. Mass-radius loci above a pure-water composition planet correspond to RMAH {\textgreater} 0. The statistical confidence of a planet maintaining an extended atmosphere can be therefore easily calculated to provide a simple ranking of target planets for follow-up observations. We also discuss how this metric can be useful in the interpretation of the spectra of observed planetary atmospheres.},

Our understanding of their formation is tied to exoplanet internal structure models, which rely upon equations of state of light elements and compounds such as water. Here, we present shock compression data for water with unprecedented accuracy that show that water equations of state commonly used in planetary modeling significantly overestimate the compressibility at conditions relevant to planetary interiors. Furthermore, we show that its behavior at these conditions, including reflectivity and isentropic response, is well-described by a recent first-principles based equation of state. These findings advocate that this water model be used as the standard for modeling Neptune, Uranus, and “hot Neptune” exoplanets and should improve our understanding of these types of planets.},

abstract = {We use models of thermal evolution and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) driven mass loss to explore the composition and history of low-mass, low-density transiting planets. We investigate the Kepler-11 system in detail and provide estimates of both the current and past planetary compositions. We find that an H/He envelope on Kepler-11b is highly vulnerable to mass loss. By comparing to formation models, we show that in situ formation of the system is extremely difficult. Instead we propose that it is a water-rich system of sub-Neptunes that migrated from beyond the snow line. For the broader population of observed planets, we show that there is a threshold in bulk planet density and incident flux above which no low-mass transiting planets have been observed. We suggest that this threshold is due to the instability of H/He envelopes to XUV-driven mass loss. Importantly, we find that this mass-loss threshold is well reproduced by our thermal evolution/contraction models that incorporate a standard mass-loss prescription. Treating the planets' contraction history is essential because the planets have significantly larger radii during the early era of high XUV fluxes. Over time low-mass planets with H/He envelopes can be transformed into water-dominated worlds with steam envelopes or rocky super-Earths. Finally, we use this threshold to provide likely minimum masses and radial-velocity amplitudes for the general population of Kepler candidates. Likewise, we use this threshold to provide constraints on the maximum radii of low-mass planets found by radial-velocity surveys.},

We first explain why the observed hot Super Earths probably formed by in situ accretion or inward migration. We show how terrestrial planet formation is altered in systems with gas giants by the mechanisms of giant planet migration and dynamical instabilities. Standard models of terrestrial accretion fail to reproduce the inner Solar System. The "Grand Tack" model solves this problem using ideas first developed to explain the giant exoplanets.

This model is the first to be applicable to all H(2)O phases in these wide ranges, which exceed the stability domain of all phases. Developing empirical or semiempirical expressions for the specific volumes of liquid water or ices has been necessary. The model has been tested on available experimental data sets. The specific volume of liquid water is reproduced with an accuracy better than 1{\%}. The error on the specific volume of ices remains within 2{\%}. The model has also been used to describe the melting curves of high-pressure ice polymorphs and compared with new Simon equations fitting available data. Our calculations suggest a slight revision of the triple point positions in the H(2)O phase diagram. We have ensured the reliability of our model up to 1.5 GPa, and we have shown that it can be used with good confidence up to 2.2 GPa. In order to show the validity of this model in the low-temperature domains, the melting curve of ice Ih in the water-ammonia system has been modeled. This curve is reproduced with good accuracy down to 180 K, at a 1 bar pressure. It shows that this model can be used in further studies for modeling equilibriums involving liquid or solid phases of H(2)O under pressure and for investigating the effect of inhibitors in complex water-rich systems.},

abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 sec readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 sec candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2{\%}, 4-10{\%} and 10{\%} for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50{\%} of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission, combined with ground-based radial velocity (RV) follow-up and dynamical analyses of transit timing variations, has revolutionized the observational constraints on sub-Neptune-sized planet compositions. The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than ∼50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/801/1/41/apj508914ieqn1.gif] {\{}1.6$\backslash$;{\{}{\{}R{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$oplus {\}}{\}}{\}} planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of “Earth-like” planets, {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/801/1/41/apj508914ieqn2.gif] {\{}{\{}{\{}$\eta${\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$oplus {\}}{\}}{\}} .},

abstract = {Exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared using Hubble/NICMOS is currently ambiguous because different observational groups claim different results from the same data, depending on their analysis methodologies. Spatial scanning with Hubble/WFC3 provides an opportunity to resolve this ambiguity. We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our errors are within 6-percent (XO-1) and 26-percent (HD209458b) of the photon-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than 0.01-percent per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. Our result for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD209458b is reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. (2002). Model atmospheres having uniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm{\^{}}2 per gram account approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in this planet. Our results for HD209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. (2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the extra opacity needed for HD209458b is grayer than for HD189733b, with a weaker Rayleigh component.},
