titleimage-description: "Water can exist in any of several different phases. As well as its familiar vapour, liquid and solid forms, it becomes a supercritical fluid, exotic ice or plasma when heated or compressed. These colourful circles represent a variety of potential structures for planets that are covered in thick layers of water. Essentially, they are models of giant snowballs."
