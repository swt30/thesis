quotes:
  - quote: Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you've got a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babiesâ€”God damn it, you've got to be kind.
    author: Kurt Vonnegut
  - quote: |
           | Within your lifetime will, perhaps,
           | As souvenirs from distant suns
           | Be carried back to earth some maps\marginnote{In 1977, it was proved that four colours are enough to colour a map such that adjacent colours are always different. This poem was written while that four-colour theorem was still a conjecture.}
           | Of planets and you'll find that one's
           | So hard to color that you've got
           | To use five crayons. Maybe, not.
    author: Marlow Sholander, "Maybe"
  - quote: |
           | Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
           | Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit
    author: Pink Floyd, "Learning to Fly"

dedication: For those who heard my dreams and said, "Go for it."

A colophon may also be emblematic or pictorial in nature. Colophons were formerly printed at the ends of books, but in modern works they are usually located at the verso of the title-leaf.
